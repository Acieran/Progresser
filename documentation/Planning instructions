Okay, it’s great that you’re recognizing the importance of planning before diving back into the code. Overthinking and redoing is a common trap when you don’t have a solid structure. Let’s break down how to plan your To-Do List app (Telegram bot -> API -> Frontend).

Here’s a structured approach you can take:

Phase 1: Requirements Gathering and Definition

Core Functionality: (Keep it focused and simple initially!)

What are the absolute essential features?
Create a new to-do list.
Add tasks to a list.
Mark tasks as complete.
View tasks within a list.
Delete/Edit tasks.
Delete lists.
Show overall progress of a list (percentage complete).
What are the “nice-to-have” features you can add later? (Put these in a separate backlog)
Set due dates for tasks.
Set priorities (high, medium, low).
Recurring tasks.
Sharing lists with others.
Reminders (through Telegram).
Tags/Categories for lists.
User Stories: Write down how you (as a user) will interact with the app. This will help you understand the user experience.

Example:
“As a user, I want to be able to create a new to-do list with a name so that I can organize my tasks.”
“As a user, I want to be able to add tasks to a specific list so that I can keep track of my to-dos.”
“As a user, I want to be able to mark a task as complete so that I can see my progress.”
“As a user, I want to see the percentage of tasks completed in a list so that I can get a sense of how much is left to do.”
“As a user, I want to edit task name”
Constraints: What limitations are you facing?

Time: How much time do you realistically have to dedicate to this project?
Budget: (If any, though likely minimal for a personal project).
Technical Skills: What are you comfortable with, and what will you need to learn?
Platform: (Telegram, Web Browser, etc.)
Phase 2: Design and Architecture

System Architecture Diagram: Draw a high-level diagram of how the different parts of your app will interact. This doesn’t need to be overly complex, but it will help you visualize the flow of data.

[Telegram Bot]  <-->  [API (Backend)]  <-->  [Database]  <--> [Frontend]

Telegram Bot: Handles user interaction (receiving commands, sending messages).
API (Backend): The “brains” of the app. Handles requests from the bot and frontend, interacts with the database, and performs business logic (e.g., creating/updating tasks, calculating progress).
Database: Stores your to-do lists and tasks.
Frontend: User Interface where user can perform all basic tasks.
API Design: Plan your API endpoints (URLs) and the data that will be sent and received (request and response formats). Think in terms of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for lists and tasks.

Examples:
POST /lists: Create a new list. (Request body: list name)
GET /lists: Get all lists for a user.
GET /lists/{listId}: Get a specific list.
PUT /lists/{listId}: Update a list. (Request body: updated list name)
DELETE /lists/{listId}: Delete a list.
POST /lists/{listId}/tasks: Add a task to a list. (Request body: task description)
GET /lists/{listId}/tasks: Get all tasks for a list.
PUT /tasks/{taskId}: Update a task (e.g., mark as complete).
DELETE /tasks/{taskId}: Delete a task.
Data Model: Define the structure of your data. What fields will you store for each list and task?

List:
id (integer, primary key)
name (string)
user_id (integer, foreign key - if you plan to support multiple users later, even just yourself with different accounts)
created_at (timestamp)
updated_at (timestamp)
Task:
id (integer, primary key)
list_id (integer, foreign key)
description (string)
is_complete (boolean)
created_at (timestamp)
updated_at (timestamp)
Technology Stack: Choose your tools. This is important because it will impact your development speed and the skills you need to learn.

Telegram Bot: python-telegram-bot (Python library). You seem to have already started with this.
API (Backend):
Language: Python (Flask or FastAPI), Node.js (Express), Go, or other backend language you are familiar with.
Framework: FastAPI is generally recommended for its speed, ease of use, and automatic documentation. Flask is another very popular Python option.
Database:
SQLite: Simple, file-based database. Great for small projects and local development. Easy to set up.
PostgreSQL: More robust and scalable relational database. Good for learning and if you anticipate needing more features later.
MongoDB: NoSQL document database. Can be useful if your data model is very flexible.
Frontend:
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: The fundamentals.
Framework (Optional): React, Vue.js, Angular. A framework can help you build a more complex frontend more efficiently. For simplicity and learning, you might consider just sticking with plain JavaScript initially. React is a very popular choice for portfolio projects.
CSS Framework (Optional): Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Materialize. These can help you style your app quickly.
Phase 3: Implementation (Iterative Development)

Start with the Core: Focus on getting the essential features working first. Don’t try to build everything at once.
Incremental Development: Build the Telegram bot interactions, then the API endpoints for the core functionality. Test each piece thoroughly before moving on.
Version Control: Use Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to track your changes. Commit your code frequently with meaningful messages.
Testing: Write unit tests for your API endpoints. This will help you catch bugs early and ensure your code is working as expected.
Documentation: Document your API endpoints, data model, and any important design decisions. This will be helpful for yourself and anyone else who might want to understand your code.
Deployment: Plan how you will deploy your API and frontend.
API: Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean.
Frontend: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages.
Phase 4: Frontend Development

API interaction design: How will frontend make API request and how will it display information, like create a new task button, etc.
Example Workflow (Specific Example of Implementation Steps):

Database Setup (SQLite):
Create a database file (todo.db).
Define the tables (List, Task) using SQL. You can use a Python library like sqlite3 or an ORM like SQLAlchemy.
API (FastAPI):
Create a FastAPI app.
Define API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting lists and tasks.
Use SQLAlchemy to interact with the database.
Implement the logic to calculate progress.
Telegram Bot:
Modify your existing bot to use the API.
Implement commands to create lists, add tasks, mark tasks as complete, and view progress.
Frontend (React):
Set up a React project.
Create components to display lists and tasks.
Use fetch or axios to make API requests.
Implement forms for creating and updating lists and tasks.
Tips for Success:

Keep it Simple: Start with the bare minimum and add features incrementally.
Focus on Learning: Don’t be afraid to experiment and try new things.
Break Down Tasks: Divide the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
Don’t Get Bogged Down in Perfection: It’s better to have a working app with some imperfections than a perfect app that never gets finished.
Ask for Help: Don’t hesitate to ask for help from online communities or friends.
Document Everything: Write down your design decisions, API endpoints, and code. This will help you remember what you did and why you did it.
Addressing Your Specific Concerns:

Overthinking: Having a plan will help you avoid overthinking. Refer back to your plan when you start to get lost in the details.
Redoing: A well-defined plan will reduce the need to redo things. But don’t be afraid to refactor your code if you find a better way to do something.
Portfolio: Document your project thoroughly and write a detailed README file. This will showcase your skills and design decisions to potential employers.
Learning: Focus on learning new technologies and techniques. Don’t be afraid to experiment and try new things.
By following these steps, you’ll be able to build your To-Do List app in a more structured and efficient way. Good luck! Let me know if you have specific questions about any of these steps.





Yes, that’s a good start! Defining core, “good but not necessary”, and additional features is a great way to prioritize your work and avoid scope creep. Here’s a breakdown of why it’s good and some suggestions to make it even better:

Strengths:

Clear Core Functionality: You’ve identified the essential features for a functional to-do list app: creation, adding tasks, marking completion, viewing, editing/deleting, and progress tracking.
Separation of Concerns: Distinguishing between features of varying importance is crucial for iterative development. Focusing on the core features first will allow you to get a working product out faster.
“Good but Not Necessary” Category: This is a smart category. It acknowledges features that would enhance the user experience but aren’t essential for the app to function. This is good for a future version release.
Suggestions for Improvement:

Refine “Workspace” Terminology:

The term “Workspace” might be too broad or ambiguous for a simple to-do list app. Consider using terms that are more directly related to task organization:
List: (Simple and common)
Project: (If you want to imply a larger collection of tasks)
Category: (If you want to group tasks by topic)
Choose the term that best reflects how you want to organize your tasks. Using more common terms, such as lists, could also be beneficial for when you add it to your portfolio.

Clarify “Make Interactable Buttons”:

Is this referring to buttons within the Telegram bot, the frontend, or both? Be specific. If it’s about rich formatting (buttons, menus) in the Telegram bot, consider if that’s truly core or more of a nice-to-have feature for the initial version. You can build a functional bot with text-based commands and responses.
Rename “Additional Features”:

“Additional Features” is a bit generic. Consider a more descriptive name like:
Future Enhancements:
Version 2.0 Features:
Stretch Goals:
Backlog: (A common term in agile development)
Add Detail to Core Functionality (Example):

To make the planning even more concrete, consider adding a bit more detail to the core features. For example:
Create a new Workspace (List): “As a user, I want to be able to create a new list with a name so I can organize my tasks.” (This relates to user stories, as we discussed earlier).
Mark tasks as complete: “As a user, I want to be able to mark a task as complete with a single action (e.g., a button click or a Telegram command) so that I can easily track my progress.”
Edit tasks: “As a user, I want to be able to edit a task’s description so that I can correct mistakes or update the task’s details.”
Consider the Frontend First: While the core function is great, think about the frontend capabilities that a user would want to see, then match those with your core functionality.

Revised Example (using “List” instead of “Workspace”):

Core Functionality:

Create a new List (give it a name).
Add tasks to a List (with a description).
Mark tasks as complete/incomplete.
View all tasks within a specific List.
Edit task descriptions.
Delete tasks.
Delete Lists.
Show overall progress of a List (percentage complete).
Good, but Not Necessary (Initial Version):

Rich formatting in Telegram Bot (e.g., buttons and menus).
Make nested tasks.
Future Enhancements/Backlog:

Set due dates for tasks.
Set priorities (high, medium, low).
Recurring tasks.
Sharing lists with others.
Tags/Categories for Lists.
Reminders (through Telegram).
Summary:

Your initial breakdown is a solid foundation. By refining the terminology, adding detail, and clarifying the categories, you’ll have an even clearer roadmap for your project. Remember to keep the scope manageable and prioritize the core functionality to get a working app quickly.




Those are good starting points for user stories, but they can be significantly improved to be more user-centered and actionable. Remember, user stories should focus on the value the user receives, not just the technical steps. Also, user stories often follow the format:

“As a [user role], I want [goal/desire] so that [benefit/reason].”

Here’s a breakdown of your existing user stories and suggestions for improvement:

1. /Start Command:

Current: “User sends “/Start” on a bot. Bot sends him overall info and list of available commands (and marks buttons with these commands).”
Problems: Focuses on the technical interaction, not the user’s motivation or benefit. What value does the user get from this?
Improved User Story:
“As a new user of the To-Do List Bot, I want to receive a welcome message with a brief explanation of the bot’s purpose and a clear list of available commands (with buttons) so that I can quickly understand how to use the bot and get started managing my tasks.”
Explanation of Improvements:
User Role: Clearly identifies “new user.”
Goal/Desire: Highlights the desire to “quickly understand how to use the bot.”
Benefit/Reason: Explains the “why” - “get started managing my tasks.”
2. /View Command:

Current: “User sends “/View” command. Bot sends a list of available Workspaces (and marks buttons for them) or informs there are None.”
Problems: Again, focuses on the technical interaction. Doesn’t explain why the user wants to view workspaces.
Improved User Story:
“As a user, I want to be able to use the /view command to see a list of my available Lists (Workspaces), presented as buttons for easy selection, so that I can quickly access and manage the tasks within a specific list.”
“As a user, if I have no existing Lists (Workspaces), I want the bot to inform me clearly that there are none available and suggest creating a new one, so I’m not left confused about how to proceed.”
Explanation of Improvements:
Goal/Desire: Emphasizes the need to “quickly access and manage the tasks within a specific list.”
Handles Empty State: Addresses what happens when there are no workspaces. This is important for good UX.
3. Viewing a Specific Workspace:

Current: “User sends a name of Workspace he wants to view. Bot sends some kind of representation of Workspace (!!!Need to figure out best one)”
Problems: Vague. The most important part is missing: What should the representation of the workspace look like? This requires more thought and design.
Improved User Story (with assumptions about the desired representation):
“As a user, after selecting a specific List (Workspace), I want the bot to display a clear and concise list of all tasks within that list, showing each task’s description and its completion status (e.g., with a checkmark or ‘Done’ indicator), so that I can easily see what needs to be done and track my progress.”
Explanation of Improvements:
Clearly Defined Output: Specifies the desired representation of the workspace (list of tasks with descriptions and completion status). This will drive the design of your Telegram bot output.
General Tips for Writing User Stories:

Focus on Value: Always ask “Why does the user want this?”
Keep it Concise: User stories should be short and easy to understand.
Be Specific: Avoid vague terms like “some kind of representation.”
Think About Edge Cases: What happens in unusual situations (e.g., no workspaces, network errors, invalid input)?
Prioritize: Not all user stories are created equal. Some are more critical to the core functionality than others.
Use Actionable Language: User stories should be clear enough that a developer can understand what needs to be implemented.
Independent: Each user story should be self-contained and not dependent on other stories.
Negotiable: The details of a user story can be discussed and refined.
Valuable: Each story should provide value to the user.
Estimable: It should be possible to estimate the effort required to implement a story.
Small: Stories should be small enough to be completed in a short period of time.
Testable: It should be possible to write tests to verify that a story has been implemented correctly.
Example of Expanding User Stories:

You can expand the user story for “viewing a specific workspace” into multiple stories to cover different aspects:

“As a user, I want the tasks in a list to be displayed in chronological order (oldest first) so that I can see the tasks I’ve been putting off the longest.”
“As a user, I want to be able to easily identify completed tasks in the list (e.g., with strikethrough text or a different color) so that I can quickly see what I’ve accomplished.”
Key Takeaway:

The improved user stories are better because they focus on the user’s goals and benefits, not just the technical steps. They also prompt you to think more deeply about the user experience and the specific details of the app’s functionality. Keep asking “Why?” and “What does the user expect to see?” and you’ll write much more effective user stories.
